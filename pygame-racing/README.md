# Pygame starter

Some classes to help you get started following this excellent tutorial https://pythonprogramming.net/pygame-python-3-part-1-intro/


First install and create a virtual environment, so pygame and other libraries/modules are only installed for this project
```
pip install virtualenv

python -m venv env
```

Then install the libraries we need, these are in the `requirements.txt` file

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
